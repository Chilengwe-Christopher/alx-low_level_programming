## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the ALX Low-Level Programming repository! This README will provide you with essential information about the course, its curriculum, and how to get started.

## 2. What is ALX Low-Level Programming?

ALX Low-Level Programming is a comprehensive course designed to teach you the fundamentals of low-level programming languages, primarily focused on the C programming language. This course is a part of ALX School, which aims to provide practical and hands-on software engineering education.

Low-level programming involves writing code that interacts directly with a computer's hardware. This is a crucial skill for aspiring software engineers as it provides a deep understanding of how computers work at the lowest level.

## 3. Course Curriculum

The ALX Low-Level Programming course covers a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Introduction to C programming
- Memory management and pointers
- Data structures and algorithms
- File I/O and system calls
- Debugging techniques
- Compilation and linking
- Shell scripting
- And more!

The curriculum is designed to provide you with a strong foundation in low-level programming concepts and practical skills that are highly valuable in the software development industry.
